@tommytt2233 since no one is actually answering your question - Apparently it's both at once. He flew to France and Italy during week 1-2 in June, then to LA and Washington on June 15th and 16th. Then he holed up in Camp David for a week before the debate.

France / Italy have the same timezone. So does LA and Washington. Though traveling can take its toll, you'd think a full week of recovery would make him ready. But when you're that old maybe recovery is much longer. Of course it's up to voters whether people buy the excuse.

I have coworkers who speak English as a second or even third language. To make my docstrings and documentation easier to understand, I added a restriction - "You may only use 1000 unique words" and made myself a list. Still, even though I made that list, I accidentally would still write words like "detected" instead of "found", "generate" instead of "create", "extract" instead of "get", etc. Old habits die hard.

spellbound.nvim exists in order to:

- Help point out hard words and suggest easier words instead
- Jump to these suggested words easily
- View suggestions entire projects

A nice side effect of this plugin - if docstrings are easier for second/third English speakers, chances are its even easier to read for native speakers too.

I have a setup that works well but spellbound.nvim is an attempt to make a generic plugin
that others can use. If you try this out, please let me know how it goes for you. Thanks!

- Update debugprint to v2+

Request jumplist support for debugging

Often when debugging it's useful to step quickly through the code until some area of interest is found. Sometimes you realize that you've past the area of interest and are actually now in a different function, with a different call stack. If we had `<c-p>`/`<c-o>` to go backwards, we'd be able to effectively retrace the movements of the debugger to get to the current point. However to use `<c-p>`/`<c-o>`, (Neo)vim requires cursor positions to be added to the jump list.
