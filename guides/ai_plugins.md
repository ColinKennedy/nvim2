## Context Generator Tools
https://github.com/k2589/LLuMinate.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file
- Includes hover information of various symbols and creates a "rich context prompt" from them. Looks useful

https://github.com/0xrusowsky/nvim-ctx-ingest
- A really great context overview tool, for LLMs

https://github.com/ahkohd/context.nvim
- Comes with some canned context things. Looks maybe too granular to be useful. Maybe not

https://github.com/S1M0N38/ctx.nvim
- It converts quickfix / location list information to markdown, for LLMs. This looks like it's https://github.com/ahkohd/context.nvim but more purposeful

https://github.com/bytehunt/code2prompt.nvim
- The demonstration GIF is a bit fast but it looks like basically "convert this to a
  prompt" but has template support so you can quickly style the selection for a specific
  purpose


## Misc
https://github.com/oflisback/describe-command.nvim
- An AI that helps you write Vim / Neovim commands

https://github.com/psaia/prompt-ai.vim
- Another AI that runs Vim/Neovim commands and is still a general-use AI tool

https://github.com/iovdin/tune.nvim
- Looks like a really simple AI editor. I love that you can keep editing the file from any position to regenerate a response from-scratch

https://github.com/3ZsForInsomnia/token-count.nvim
- A token counter so you can see how many tokens something would take in order to run. It probably just runs tiktokenizer in the background but still helpful


https://github.com/S1M0N38/chatml.nvim
- It helps you write in-markdown but then get the JSON equivalent (to send to LLMs) and converts from JSON back to markdown. It's a bit meh

https://github.com/mozanunal/sllm.nvim/blob/main/PREFACE.md
- This looks really interesting. You can provide a function as a tool for an AI, just by selecting the function

https://github.com/efugier/smartcat
- A pipe-able AI CLI tool. Looks nice

https://github.com/piersolenski/wtf.nvim
- A tool that helps you prompt the stuff that is hard to select in Neovim (e.g. diagnostic messages)
- You could use another AI tool that gets the context information to the clipboard. And
  if you do have a plugin like that, it's not clear how useful this plugin is anymore

https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua
- It has Next Edit Suggestion, supposedly

https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim
- Looks actually useful, unlike the others

https://github.com/Exafunction/windsurf.vim
- Looks like it has a Next Edit Suggestion built-in. I'm not sure about the output of
  the suggestions though


## Unclear How Much This Is Helping
https://github.com/oelmekki/make-my-code-better.vim
- Seems like this is just a custom prompt and doesn't do much

https://github.com/AdrianMosnegutu/docscribe.nvim
- Docstrings that restate the code are pointless. So I doubt this plugin is any good.

https://github.com/you-n-g/simplegpt.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#code-completion--instruct-editing
- This looks a bit useful but it's too in-the-weeds. I can't get an idea of how useful or not it would be


## It's A Chatbot / AI-Slop Plugin
