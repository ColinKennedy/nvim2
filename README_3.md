  - go :message
  - it fills the screen, weirdly


- Check out circles.nvim
- https://github.com/folke/neodev.nvim

- vim config clean-up
 - change manifest / data code to just "plugins" / "configs" - Use NvChad as an example

- lazy's window stylesheet is gross. Fix
- Disable trailing whitespace from lazy's pop-up window

- command line completion should have icons and other fun stuff

- Add ``did`` support. See ``require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup``

- disable trailing whitespace from mason-style GUIs
- neogen raises docstring stuff doesn't work as expected
 - https://github.com/danymat/neogen/issues/139

- Change af / if to match preceding comment lines. For God's sake

- Remove after/ files, maybe. They probably aren't needed
- try installing this on a fresh machine

- It'd be nice if the cursor centering doesn't break
 - Possible solution? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64280931/keep-cursor-line-vertically-centered-in-vim
- Ask treesitter people about module highlighting
- Is it possible to add devicons / LSP information into Command mode?
