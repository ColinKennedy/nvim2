- Add FZF and ripgrep for faster wilder.nvim completion and stuff

- Add ``super`` Lua snippet (use treesitter)

- vim config clean-up
 - change manifest / data code to just "plugins" / "configs" - Use NvChad as an example

- Add ``did`` support. See ``require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup``

- Change af / if to match preceding comment lines. For God's sake

- Remove after/ files, maybe. They probably aren't needed

- aerial.nvim - don't resize when you move your cursor left / right

- Ask treesitter people about module highlighting
 - Can Python highlight based on modules?
- Is it possible to add devicons / LSP information into Command mode?

- Sometimes BackupCurrentFile is slow. Consider rewriting in Lua
